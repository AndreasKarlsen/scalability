\lone[inline]{Reflection on choice of concurrency models}
\lone[inline]{Evaluation of implementation effort}
\lone[inline]{Reflection on choice of distance measure}
\lone[inline]{Readability and Wriability as requirements. Tightly coupled to implementation}
\lone[inline]{Count clock cycles since STM can perform extra work, where TL waits (wastes no cycles)}
\lone[inline]{k-means is good for parallel, but sucks for concurrency. Realization point: When we realized, all implementations only need to sync when the mappers delivers to the reducers}
\lone[inline]{We wanted to compare the models, but there is variations of the models, which we did not know when we started}
\lone[inline]{We using models to be more general about the concepts. But we use a specific implementations. There is a dilemma between not judging on the same implementations in concepts and performance, but also wanting to cover more than a specific implementation}
