}{% the abstract
Today the increase in \acs{CPU} speed comes in additional cores. To utilise the potential of the \acs{CPU} while ensuring correctness, programmers must use special techniques. We investigate trending concurrency models, and analyse both their runtime performance and characteristics. Java, Clojure and Scala with Akka, was chosen as representatives for \acs{TL}, \acs{STM}, and the actor model respectively. We argue that the performance difference in most cases are neglectable. The characteristics differs greatly, and none of the models is a silver bullet. Each model shines in different scenarios, and so we contribute with a suggestion of when to use each model.
