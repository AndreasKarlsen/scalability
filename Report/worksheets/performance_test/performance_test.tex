In order to investigate the performance of the selected models, a performance test will be conducted.
\label{chap:performance}
\section{Definition of Performance Test Approach}
 The $k$-means clustering algorithm has been selected as the basis for the comparison. $k$-means is a good basis for performance analysis of concurrency models as it is computationally demanding and easily partitioned into concurrent tasks\cite[p. 128]{epstein2011towards}. The $k$-means algorithm has been employed by others to measure scalability performance\cite{epstein2011towards}\cite{tardieu2014x10} The N-body problem used for comparison in \cite{totoo2012haskell} was considered as an alternative.

$k$-means aims at clustering $n$ data points, into $k \leq n$ clusters\cite[p. 451]{dataminingconceptsandtechniques}\cite[p. 128]{epstein2011towards}. Each cluster $k$ is initially assigned a random centroid representing the mean of the cluster. For each of the data points, a distance to the centroid of each of the $k$ clusters is calculated. The data point is then assigned to the cluster to which it is closest. After every data point has been assigned, new centroids are calculated, based on the data points assigned to the clusters. The process is then repeated, using the newly calculated clusters centroids as the basis for the distance calculations. The algorithm terminates when the cluster centroids stop changing or when a set number of iterations has been completed\cite[p. 128]{epstein2011towards}. The algorithm is exemplified in \bsref{fig:kmeans}. Centroids are represented by triangles and data points by circles.

\end{figure}

Two tests, each with their own purpose, will be conducted. Both tests will be based on a data set of vectors, where each vector consists of 100 integer data points. In the context of performance analysis, only the effort taken to cluster the data is of interest, as opposed to the resulting clustering. As a result, randomly generated data is sufficient.

The first test will be based on a fixed size data set, while the number of concurrent tasks will be scaled up. The goal is to determine how the selected concurrency models, scale as more concurrent tasks are added. The test will be based on a data set of 1,000,000 vectors. Five clusters will be created, using a maximum of eight concurrent tasks. The algorithm will run for 10 iterations.

The second second test will be based on a fixed number of concurrent tasks, while the size of the dataset will be scaled up. The goal of this test is to determine how the selected concurrency model, scale as the size of the dataset increases. The test will be conducted using four concurrent tasks, while scaling the data set from 100,000 vectors to 5,000,000 vectors. As with the previous test, five clusters will be created and the algorithm will run for 10 iterations.

The parameters of the two tests are depicted in \bsref{tab:test_description}.

The implementations will follow a template similar to that of Map-Reduce\cite{dean2008mapreduce}, known from functional programming, as well as the Google and Hadoop MapReduce frameworks. MapReduce employs a set of mappers to apply a function to each data point. This function outputs a number of results, that are then aggregated to the final result using a reducer. This is analogous to the \bscode{map} and \bscode{reduce} functions, known from functional programming. For the $k$-means performance test, a set of mappers will be assigned a set of vectors, for which it will calculate the distance to each of the $k$ cluster centroids and assign it to the nearest cluster. A reducer will then aggregate the results from the mappers and calculate the new cluster centroids. The process will continue until the stated 10 iterations are achieved.

\subsection{Distance Measure}
A large part of the computations involved in the $k$-means algorithm, lies in calculating the distance between each of the data points and the cluster centroids. Different ways of calculating this distance exists. Simple, yet efficient, calculations such as Manhattan and Euclidean\cite[p. 41]{amatriain2011data} distances are fast to compute. Where the more complex similarity measures such as Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Cosine similarity\cite[p. 42]{amatriain2011data}\cite{breese1998empirical} are slower to compute but provide a more accurate result.

\kasper[inline]{Remember to draw in the choice of distance measure in reflection}
The \ac{PCC} will be used for the performance test, as it represents one of the most complex computations. Having a complex distance calculation will increase the workload which will be run concurrently, increasing the focus on the concurrency aspect of the performance test. We are aware that choosing a complex calculation, pushes the results towards favoring concurrent execution over sequential execution. The \ac{PCC} is 
defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{pearsonverbose}
\frac{cov(a,i)}{\sigma_a \times \sigma_i} = \frac{\sum_j(v_{a,j}-\bar{v}_a)(v_{i,j}-\bar{v}_i)}{\sqrt{{\sum_j}(v_{a,j}-\bar{v}_a)^2 \sum_j(v_{i,j}-\bar{v}_i)^2}}
\end{equation}

where $cov(a,i)$ is the covariance between the two vectors $a$ and $i$ and $\sigma_a \times \sigma_i$ is the product of the vectors standard deviations.
