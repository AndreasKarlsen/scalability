This chapter presents the actor concurrency model by describing the key concepts in \bsref{sec:actor_concepts}. Afterwards in \bsref{sec:actor_con_issues} we present how the actor model relates to the concurrency issues presented in the \ac{TL} model. Hereafter a discussion about the actor model is presented in \bsref{sec:actor_discussion}. Finally in \bsref{sec:actor_charac} we evaluate the actor model using the characteristics previously defined in \bsref{chap:char}.

\section{Key Concepts}\label{sec:actor_concepts}
The actor model is an inherently concurrent model where the main abstraction and building block is actors\cite[p. 2]{karmani2009actor}. An actor is an entity that has the following essential elements of computation\cite{actorLangNextVideo}: processing, storage, and communication. The actor is able to process instructions e.g. adding numbers together or concatenating strings. The actor is also able to store data on itself e.g. the result of some processing or some value communicated from another actor. We will explain the storage and communication elements in more detail throughout the section.

Actors are independent concurrently running entities that communicate with each other solely through asynchronous message passing\cite[p. 304]{tasharofi2013scala}. Upon receiving a message the actor examines it and determines how it will react, which can be in a number of ways\cite[p. 2]{hewitt2014actor}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Send messages to known actors
\item Create new actors
\item Modify internal state or behaviour
\end{enumerate}
An actor can choose to react by doing one or more of the above or none if the actor is not interested in the message it receives. Additionally the actor may also do some processing. We will now describe each case in more detail in the following three subsections.

\subsection{Send Messages to Known Actors}
In the first case an actor may send messages to other actors on the premise that is has the address of the actors. It is also allowed for an actor to send messages to itself. Each actor has a unique address which is represented in the actor model by a unique immutable name of an actor\cite[p. 2]{karmani2009actor}. It is then the responsibility of the chosen actor framework to map actor names to more direct addresses such as memory or network addresses, depending on implementation strategy and runtime location\cite[p. 3]{hewitt2014actor}. Addresses cannot be guessed but must be communicated. An actor \bscode{A} can know the address of another actor \bscode{B} if \bscode{A} creates \bscode{B} or receives the address of \bscode{B} as a message from an actor. Typically the exclamation mark (!) is used as the symbol to indicate sending a message. This is shown in the following example where the hello message is asynchronously sent to actor \bscode{A}:
\begin{verbatim}
A ! "hello"
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Create New Actors}
In the second case an actor can choose to create one or more new actors, the new actors will then be child actors of the creating actor. This may be attractive when an actor receives a compute intensive task as it then can create a number of new child actors and delegate the work amongst them. \bsref{fig:actor_lifecycle} presents an illustration of the life cycle of an actor. When an actor is created it is typically started also which brings the actor into an active phase. In the active phase an actor awaits messages until it retrieves a message which it will then process and upon completion the actor will again be ready to receive a new message. At some point an actor may be stopped which brings it to an inactive phase where no messages are processed and it will only go into the active phase again if it is started.

\caption{Lifecycle of an actor inspired by \cite[Figure 12]{subramaniam2011programming}}\label{fig:actor_lifecycle}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Modify Internal State or Behaviour}
In the last case an actor can choose to modify internal state or behaviour. Each actor has internal isolated state where only the actor itself is responsible and allowed to modify state. Furthermore actors have internal behaviour, typically in the form of behaviour methods, which describes how a certain type of message should be handled. For example if an actor receives an \bscode{A} message it will use the \bscode{A} behaviour method, similarly  if an actor receives a \bscode{B} message it will use the \bscode{B} behaviour method. When an actor modifies internal behaviour it will take effect for the next message to be processed. So in the third case an actor can modify internal state by updating state or change the internal behaviour by changing one or more behaviour methods. 

Hereby we end our description of how an actor may react to a message and will now describe how an actor receives messages.

\subsection{Mailbox and Message Order}
A single actor may receive many messages in a short time period which it must be able to handle without failing. To accommodate this, each actor has an associated mailbox where messages sent to the actor is buffered in\cite[Chap. 2.6]{haller2012actors}. Messages can arrive in the mailbox at any time and it will hold the messages until the actor has processed them. An actor will retrieve one message at a time from its mailbox and process it in one atomic step\cite[p. 2]{karmani2009actor}.

The arrival order of messages to an actor is non-deterministic due to the asynchronous message passing communication between actors\cite[p. 2]{karmani2011actors}. The reason is, that messages may take arbitrary long time to arrive because of arbitrary communication delays on the network. The actor model assumes a notion of fairness which means that messages sent are eventually received by the target actor and no actor is starved\cite[Chap. 2.5]{haller2012actors}\cite[p. 3]{karmani2009actor}. This makes reasoning about actor programs easier\cite{tasharofi2013scala}. However, in a real system there are many reasons why a message can be lost, e.g. a computer may crash resulting in lost messages which means the target actor will never receive these messages which can cause starvation. It is up to the individual actor framework to adhere to the actor models principle of reliable message passing which is often accomplished through redundancy and replication\cite[Chap. 2.5]{haller2012actors}. Another reason that message arrival is non-deterministic is that there can be many concurrently running actors which may send messages in between two messages from an actor as in the following example:
\begin{verbatim}
B ! "hello"
B ! "there"
\end{verbatim}
Suppose an actor \bscode{A} sends the two messages ``hello'' and ``there'' to an actor \bscode{B}. Another concurrently running actor \bscode{C} may then send a message in-between the ``hello'' and ``there'' messages to actor \bscode{B} thereby changing the message order. That the message order is non-deterministic means that an actor must not rely on a specific message order, however according to \cite[p. 35]{haller2012actors}: \textit{``You can often alleviate reliance on message ordering by refactoring the actor communication, i.e., reworking the messages' contents''}.

\subsection{Example of an Actor system}
An actor system consists of a collection of actors. \bsref{fig:actor_overview} presents an illustration of the life cycle within an actor system. Each actor has an associated mailbox, isolated state and a number of behaviour methods. In the figure, actor \bscode{A} starts by sending a message to actor \bscode{B} which is stored in the mailbox associated to actor \bscode{B}. Then at some point when actor \bscode{B} is ready he retrieves the message from actor \bscode{A} from his mailbox and processes it based on which behaviour method the message corresponds to. In this case it corresponds to a behaviour method which creates a new actor, namely actor \bscode{C}. Actor \bscode{C} is now live and running with the other two actors awaiting messages. This is just a small view of what may happen in an actor system, meanwhile there may be other different actors concurrently running, sending messages, modifying isolated state and processing.

\caption{Example of three actors. Each actor has its own mailbox, isolated state and methods. Actors responds to messages based on internal behaviour. Actor A sends Actor B a message which then creates Actor C.}\label{fig:actor_overview}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Semantic Properties}\andreas[inline]{I think you can categorize it into the most essential properties (explained first), and a more detailed view (explained here). Just tell that to the reader}
The actor model has several important semantic properties some of which we have already covered, namely atomic processing of messages and fairness, additionally we will now look further at encapsulation and location transparency which we have only briefly described until now\cite{karmani2011actors}.

\subsubsection{Encapsulation}
Each actor must be perfectly isolated from one another, only communicating through asynchronous message passing. An actor can therefore only modify the state and behaviour methods belonging to itself. Furthermore message passing must also adhere to the principle of encapsulation by not sharing state between actors, so message passing should have call by value semantics which is often done by making a copy of the message contents\cite[p. 2]{karmani2009actor}. Encapsulation makes it easier to reason about programs modelled with the actor model\cite[p. 3]{karmani2009actor} and reduces concurrency issues which we will look at shortly in \bsref{sec:actor_con_issues}. Another benefit of encapsulation is that it eases testing of actor programs because actors can be tested in isolation as long as the tests uses the right type of messages in combination with an expected order\cite[p. 151]{sevenModels}.

\subsubsection{Location Transparency}
Actors know each other only by unique address, often in the form of an actor name, disjointed from the physical location. Location transparency provides an abstraction where the programmer does not have to worry about or specify the actual physical location of the message receiver. An actor can communicate with another actor which exists on the same core, on the same machine or on an entirely different machine across the network\cite[p. 3]{karmani2009actor}. Location transparency gives the ability to at runtime distribute execution across a cluster of machines which eases scaling beyond a single machine.

\section{Concurrency issues}\label{sec:actor_con_issues}
%evt. flyt det nederst i afsnitet eller i starten af concurrency issues
%husk også ascynchonuys natur sammen med no shared state!
\toby[inline]{Dette kaptiel er ikke færdigt endnu og indeholder bare stuff}
One of the main differences from other concurrency models, such as \ac{TL}, is that there is no notion of shared state. Instead each actor has isolated state where only the actor itself is responsible and allowed to modify state. The reason that isolated state is preferable over shared state is that some of the concurrency issues presented earlier in \bsref{sec:tl_ci} is mitigated and some even gone. 

That an actor processes messages in one isolated atomic operation reduces concurrency issues and make programs easier to reason about as multiple messages will not conflict with one another e.g. if two messages wants to update the isolated state of an actor there will be no concurrency issue in terms of race condition as only a single message will be processed at a time.

%Seven models p. 152 weaknesses
%Although a program constructed with actors is easier to debug than one constructed with threads and locks, actors are still susceptible to problems like deadlock plus a few failure modes unique to actors (such as overflowing an actor’s mailbox).


%deadlocks are still at problem in actor model (two actors awaiting messages from one another)

%raceconditions med messages processed in one atomic step
%isolated state mean that we wont have deadlocks but can instead have livelocks

%Se actors in scala chap. 1.2


%Måske noget med nemsis of the von neumann arcitecruhe = shared store (fra gul agha original)

%Hvordan forholder det sig til concurrency issues tidligere nævnt og skaber den evt. nye concurrency problemer

%en actor processer messages i et atomic step, det afhælper concurrency issues men det kan også skade concurrency fordi hvis det kun er read operationer må de jo gerne udføres samtidigt (se JVM mastering bogen)

%event-based computation model avoids blocking waits for specific messages, which helps to keep clear of deadlocks in the system. But still able to livelock as actors can await messages from one another

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:actor_discussion}
This section discusses a number of issues and weaknesses related to the actor model. In bla we will discuss bla \toby{Indsæt mere her når sektionen er skrevet}

\subsection{Sharing Behaviour Among Actors}
Inheritance is a popular and valuable mechanism often used in object-oriented programming which allows sharing of the same behaviour inside one class across multiple classes\cite{kafura1989inheritance}. So if two classes have some common functionality, it can be written only once in a super class that they both inherit from. Sharing of behaviour avoids code duplication and code reuse which also improves maintainability as the functionality should only be maintained in a single place.

In the actor model there is no direct notion of inheritance\cite{mackay1997has}. This means that it is not possible to share behaviour among actors which hurts code reuse, maintainability and makes it more time consuming to write actor programs with common behaviour. The problem of inheritance in the actor model is that actors may change behaviour over time so it is difficult to locate or copy methods at run-time in systems without shared memory\cite{kafura1989inheritance}.\toby{kig på evt. på "inheritance in actor based concurrency object-oriented lanuages" de mener der er et mere fundamentalt problem, se afsnit "4. the actor-inheritane problem" - jeg forstår det dog ikke helt - måske en anden skal se om de kan forstå det. (de har også en mulig løsning - som dog har en limitation)}

In some specific implementations of the actor model it is possible to use inheritance in combination with actors e.g. \cite{kafura1989inheritance} presents a possible solution in their ACT++ language. However in ACT++ they do not adhere to the fundamental principle of the actor model that an actor can change behaviour over time. 

An indirect way to share behaviour among actors is to use the features of the language an actor framework is implemented in e.g. in an actor framework for Scala it is possible to use the object-oriented features such as traits to share behaviour among actors.\toby{Ved ikke om jeg bare skal lade være med at nævne dette. Jeg tænker på eksempler fra dette link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17383827/how-do-i-best-share-behavior-among-akka-actors}
%Måske brug den her også
%Kilde også om inheritance \cite[Chap. 1.2]{agha1986overview}

\subsection{Actor modelling}
One of the main properties of the actor model is that an actor processes only a single message at at time. This means that no matter what type of messages that are in the mailbox, they are processed sequentially, which can result in lower concurrency for several messages only interested in ``reading'' the internal state of the actor. Messages should be fairly coarse-grained so actors can process sufficiently many tasks concurrently without having to spend time waiting for each other\cite[p. 269]{karmani2009actor}. Furthermore as the only communication is through message passing it is also more attractive to have coarse-grained messages to avoid unnecessary overhead. However the messages should not be too coarse-grained as that will hurt the dynamic among actors in the system e.g. if an actor \bscode{A} is processing a very time consuming message and another actor \bscode{B} needs a simple read of actor \bscode{A's} isolated state to continue, actor \bscode{B} must await until actor \bscode{A} is finished processing.

%Should avoid too much communication between actors as message passing is the only communication

%minimize overhead

%actor model coarse vs fine grained message

%because actors do not share state and can only communicate through message passing, they are not a suitable choice if you need fine-grained parallelism.

%coarse grained message

Not all problems are well suited for modelling with the actor model bla bla.

%Actors can handle only one message request at a time. So, both action messages and messages requesting a response or state run sequentially. This can result in lower concurrency for the tasks that are interested only in reading the value. 

%Why has the actor model not succeeded yet:
%One of the key features of actors, their ability to create other actors as part of their behaviour, has the potential to dramatically change the state of the system at any particular time. The decisions of where to store and execute newly created actors is important to overall performance, and will require records to be kept of what is executing and where.

%8.13 s. 269 Limitations of the Actor-Based Model i JVM Mastering syncrhonization

%actors provide no direct support for parallelism. Parallel solutions need to be built from concurrent building blocks, raising the specter of nondeterminism. And because actors do not share state and can only communicate through message passing, they are not a suitable choice if you need fine-grained parallelism.

%Cannot determine in adavance in which order messages are processed. non-deterministic - can be hard to grasp at first

%the argument for using actor-based programming languages is not simply that they are a good match for distributed computing platforms; it is thatActors is a goodmodel in which to think about concurrency.

%Actors simplify the task of programming by extending object-based design to concurrent (parallel, distributed, mobile) systems.

\subsection{Adhering to Actor Properties}
%Unfortunately, actor frameworks on the JVM cannot sufficiently constrain the programming environment to avoid the concurrency pitfalls that the actor model should help you avoid. After all, within the thread you are simply writing plain old java (or scala or clojure). There’s no real way to limit what that code can do, unless it is explicitly disallowed from calling into other code or looping. Therefore, even the actor frameworks which use bytecode weaving to implement cooperative multi-tasking amongst actors cannot fully guarantee non-blocking behavior. This point bears repetition: without fundamental changes in how the JVM works, one cannot guarantee that an arbitrary piece of code will not block. fra: http://boundary.com/blog/2014/09/03/no-you-cant-have-a-pony/

	%Istedet foreksempel erlang eller elxlir kan overholde disse kriterier.

%Not all actor framworks enforce all the rules of the actor model but makes that the job of the developer in some cases to improve peformance. But as it is the job of the developer now to ensure the properties of the actor model it makes til harder to write (se blue handbook actors under Semantic Properties)
