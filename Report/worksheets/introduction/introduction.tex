% Moores law, skalér med flere kerner, ikke højere CPU
% Krav til at applikationer kræver mere ydelse
% Focus på skalering til flere computere i.e. parallel computing, ikke kun flere kerner
% Brug for en evolution, inden for tilgange til at skrive parallele programmer
% Vi vil kigge på concurrency inden for rammerne af samme maskine
Moore's law\cite{moore1965cramming} is the empirical observation that the number of transistors per area, on a integrated circuit, was approximately doubled roughly every 18 months\cite[p. 203]{mack2011fifty}. As a result, processing speed kept increasing as more transistors where added. This increase has however stagnated and processing power has mainly increased in the form of additional processing cores, as opposed to the speed of each of these processing cores\cite[p. 22]{sevenModels}. That is, computers have moved from having a \ac{CPU} consisting of one single core to one having multiple cores. This tendency is displayed in \bsref{fig:moores_in_reality}.

While the need for applications to scale over multiple cores has arisen, so has the need to scale applications over multiple servers\lone{udokumenteret påstand?}. With the rise of the Internet, the number of very large services supporting millions of users has increased. Due to this, the need for\lone{udokumenteret påstand} scalable systems, and programming languages which support the scalable approach has arisen. Previously, when scalability issues arose a company might invest in a new machine capable of handling the load, effectively discarding the investment of purchasing the old machine\cite[p. 2]{haller2007actors}. A more modern approach entails scaling the service over a set of low end machines, adding and removing machines as needed. However, the applications\lone{er det applications el. developers?} need to be aware of this approach when developed. A concurrency model\lone{hvad skal den bruges til?} that can be used on both a single machine as well as in a distributed fashion, could potentially assist in addressing both scaling over multiple cores and multiple servers.

Programming languages developed while it was believed that single core performance would keep increasing, such as assembly and C, were closely related to the Von Neumann architecture. As a consequence, the programming model was designed for synchronous execution. This introduces a challenge in how programs should be written to execute efficiently on a multi-core processor. A lot of effort has been invested into identifying suitable ways of programming against such architectures\cite{shavit1997software}\cite{haller2007actors}\cite{hewitt2014actor}\cite{scherer2005advanced}. \lone[inline]{Nævn et par eksempler}
