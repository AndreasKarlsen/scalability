First off, the programmer is left alone to place the locks in the correct place and the correct order, which in itself is hard. If he succeeds of using locks as synchronization mechanism, a major caveat is that they are not composable\cite[p. 58]{sutter2005software}. That is, you cannot compose two correct lock-based pieces of code and know the result is still correct. This significantly limits the reuseability of software components, and therefore lower the productivity of the programmer.
