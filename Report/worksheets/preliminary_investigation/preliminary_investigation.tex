This chapter presents a preliminary analysis into concurrency models. The presented models have been chosen based on their historical significance, widespread use or currently ongoing research effort. The purpose of this presentation is to document our preliminary concurrency model analysis, in order to justify the choice of models to analyses further. For each model a short description will be given, along with a short presentation of what is currently state of the art within the given model. The first model to be investigated will be the traditional \ac{TL}.
%Maybe a short section about why we have chosen to look at these concurrency models?
\section{\acl{TL}}
The traditional \ac{TL} approach uses locks to limit the access to critical regions in order to ensure correct execution\cite[p. 1]{saha2006mcrt}.

\section{Actor model}
The actor model is inspired by physical laws and can be used to model, understand and reason about a wide range of concurrent systems\cite{hewitt2014actor}. The model targets both shared- and distributed-memory architectures and has support for fault tolerance\cite[Chap. 5]{sevenModels}. It is a general model for concurrency that can be used with almost any language but it is often associated with Erlang\footnote{\url{http://erlang.org}}.
 
The idea of the actor model is to use actors as the fundamental unit of computation. An actor has the following essential elements of computation\cite{actorLangNextVideo}: Processing, storage, and communication.

The actor encapsulates state and communicates with other actors by sending messages. In response to a message an actor can\cite{hewitt2014actor}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create new actors
\item Send messages to actors it knows
\item Modify internal behavior (how the next message it receives should be handled)
\end{itemize}
Actors interact with one another through asynchronous message passing. For an actor to be able to send a message to another actor it must have the address of the actor. An actor \bscode{A} can know the address of another actor \bscode{B} if \bscode{A} creates \bscode{B} or receives the address of \bscode{B} as a message from another actor.

An actor has a mailbox which messages sent to the actor arrives in. The actor dequeues the mailbox and processes one message at a time\footnote{Not true for recursion}. Messages sent can take arbitrarily long time to arrive, and if sent concurrently can arrive in a mailbox in any order\cite{hewitt2014actor}.

The actor model avoids the deadlocks and race conditions present in the \ac{TL} model, by avoiding shared state\citep[Chap. 32]{odersky2011programming}. Instead the actor model allows isolated mutable state on actors and rely solely on asynchronous message passing between actors.



\section{Reactive}

Which problem does the reactive model try to solve?
\begin{itemize}
\item Nested callbacks
\end{itemize}

How does it solves it?
\begin{itemize}
\item Organization of asynchronous tasks
\item Does not care about the concurrency model underneath
\item Rx solves the issues for concurrently generating and consuming data
\item Reverse the data flow (push instead of pull)
\end{itemize}

\section{\acl{STM}}
\ac{STM} takes an approach to concurrency, that is based on transactions as known from database theory\cite[p. 1]{shavit1997software}. \ac{STM} transitions are atomic and isolated. Atomic meaning that either all writes in a given transaction are committed, or non of them are, while isolated means that from a given transaction \bscode{T}, any other concurrently running transaction will have no impact on the values committed by \bscode{T} when \bscode{T} succeeds\cite[p. 102]{sevenModels}. These properties are similar to the \ac{ACID} properties known from databases\cite[p. 754]{elmasri2011fundamentals}.

\ac{STM} is implemented in a number of languages, including Clojure\cite[p. 101]{sevenModels}, Concurrent Haskell\cite{harris2005composable} and Scala\cite{goodman2011muts} either directly or using a library. Generally the idea is that programmers specify regions which are to be executed as a transaction. The compiler or library then takes care of ensuring that the \ac{STM} transaction principles are maintained and that the transactions are eventually committed\cite[p. 1]{saha2006mcrt}. The transaction might be retried one or more times in the process, if any other transactions read or modified the used data.

The strength of \ac{STM} lies in the avoidance of many of the issues\lone{Nævner I dem?} that plague the traditional \ac{TL} approach. \ac{STM} can avoid deadlocks, priority inversion and eliminates the issue of balancing lock granularity vs performance\cite[p. 1]{harris2005composable}.
