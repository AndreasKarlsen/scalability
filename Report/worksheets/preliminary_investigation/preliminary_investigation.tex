\worksheetstart{Preliminary investigation}{1}{September 22, 2014}{Everybody}{../../}
This chapter presents a preliminary investigation of different concurrency models. As it is not possible to go in depth with all concurrency models this chapter serves the purpose of giving an overview of these models. Based on this overview we will select which models to focus on in the project.\toby{Bud på en intro, i er velkommen til at ændre eller lave ny.} The first model to be investigated will be the traditional threads \& locks.

%Maybe a short section about why we have chosen to look at these concurrency models?
\section{Threads \& Locks}
\section{Actor model}
The actor model is inspired by physical laws and can be used to model, understand and reason about a wide range of concurrent systems\cite{hewitt2014actor}. The model targets both shared- and distributed-memory architectures and has support for fault tolerance\cite[Chap. 5]{sevenModels}. It is a general model for concurrency that can be used with almost any language but it is often associated with Erlang\footnote{erlang.org}.
 
The idea of the actor model is to use actors as the fundamental unit of computation. An actor has the following essential elements of computation\cite{actorLangNextVideo}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Processing
	\item Storage
	\item Communication
\end{itemize}
The actor encapsulates state and communicates with other actors by sending messages. In response to a message an actor can\cite{hewitt2014actor}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create new actors
\item Send messages to actors it knows
\item Modify internal behavior (how the next message it receives should be handled)
\end{itemize}
Actors interact with one another through asynchronous message passing. For an actor to be able to send a message to another actor it must have the address of the actor. An actor \bscode{A} can know the address of another actor \bscode{B} if \bscode{A} creates \bscode{B} or receives the address of \bscode{B} as a message from another actor.

An actor has a mailbox which messages sent to the actor arrives in. The actor dequeues the mailbox and processes one message at a time\footnote{Not true for recursion}. Messages sent can take arbitrarily long time to arrive, and if sent concurrently can arrive in a mailbox in any order\cite{hewitt2014actor}.

The actor model avoids shared state and thereby avoids deadlocks and race conditions which is a reality in the threads and locks model\citep[Chap. 32]{odersky2011programming}. Instead the actor model allow isolated mutable state on actors and rely solely on asynchronous message passing between actors.
