This chapter presents a preliminary investigation of different concurrency models. As it is not possible to go in depth with all concurrency models this chapter serves the purpose of giving an overview of these models. Based on this overview we will select which models to focus on in the project.\toby{Bud på en intro, i er velkommen til at ændre eller lave ny.} The first model to be investigated will be the traditional threads \& locks.

%Maybe a short section about why we have chosen to look at these concurrency models?
