\section{Characteristics}
This section presents a characteristics based comparison of the selected concurrency models.

\subsection{Implicit or Explicit Concurrency}
The placement of the three concurrency models on the implicit to explicit spectrum is shown in \bsref{fig:results_char_impli_expli}.

\ac{TL} and \ac{STM} are both placed high on the explicit end of the scale. They both require the programmer to explicitly manage threads and either use locks or transactions for marking critical regions. The actor model is more implicit than the other models as it hides the concepts of marking critical regions and low level threads. The actor model does however introduce new constructs, in the form of actors and messages, that must be explicitly used for programming concurrent programs.

\subsection{Fault Restrictive or Expressive Model}
\bsref{fig:results_char_fault_expressive} shows how the three concurrency models are placed on the fault restrictive to expressive spectrum.

\ac{STM} and \ac{TL} are both placed towards the expressive end of the scale. \ac{TL} forces very few restrictions upon the programmer which gives him freedom in relation to expressing low-level synchronization details. However, this is on the cost of the programmer being left alone in ensuring correct execution. \ac{STM} is more fault restrictive than \ac{TL} as it delegates the low-level synchronization details to the STM system. 

The actor model on the other hand is towards the fault restrictive end, as it forces many restrictions on the programmer. It allows only isolated state and communication is limited to asynchronous message passing. Furthermore the design of the model disallows multiple reads operations to happen simultaneously. Lastly, it is only possible to model concurrency with actor and the interaction between them through messages, which means it is not possible to use threads directly.

\subsection{Pessimistic or Optimistic Model}
\bsref{fig:results_char_pes_opti} the placement of the selected concurrency models on the Pessimistic - Optimistic spectrum. \ac{TL} and the actor model are pessimistic while \ac{STM} is a optimistic concurrency model. \ac{TL} guards against race conditions by providing mutual exclusion and the actor model enforces state encapsulation guarding against race conditions. \ac{STM} attempts to execute its transactions concurrently retry the transaction if any conflicts occur.
