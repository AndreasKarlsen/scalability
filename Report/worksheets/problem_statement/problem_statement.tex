%
In order to structure our investigation, we have extracted four questions. The questions are based on problems found in our preliminary investigation, which is described in the \bsref{chap:intro}. These questions will serve as a guideline of the main focus of our investigation, and will be used to conclude the degree of success of the investigation at \bsref{chap:conclusion}.

The questions we search to answer in our investigation are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which problems exists with concurrency in a multithreaded environment? 
\item What are the approaches for handling concurrency?
\item In what problem domains are the approaches most applicable?
\item How is the approaches performance comparatively?
\item How can the approaches be applied to a distributed environment?
\end{enumerate}
