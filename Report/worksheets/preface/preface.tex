This report documents project work done by group dpt907e14 at the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University. The report was written as part of the Computer Science (IT) study program in the fall of 2014 at the 9th semester.

The first time an acronym is used it will appear in the format: Threads \& Locks (TL). Inline quotations and names will appear in \textit{italics}. The work presented in this report is based on work or results described in books, articles, video lectures and research papers from outside sources. The full list of acronyms along with the bibliography and appendix, can be found at the end of the report.

One chapter contains a number of mathematical formulas. The notation and intuition of these formulas will be defined after the formula. The exact understanding of the formulas is not important, it is the understanding of the amount of work the formulas will produce when calculated on a computer.

The report was written under the assumption, that the reader has solid understanding of computer science, and basic knowledge of concurrency. The basics of concurrency will be explained in \bsref{chp:con_basics}, and can be skipped if the reader already know this. The report can be read from end to end as a coherent piece, or as the reading guide below suggests.

Chapter 4, 5, and 6 can be read individually to obtain knowledge about a specific concurrency model. Chapter 7 compares the characteristics of the concurrency models and can be read to gain an overview of its characteristic differences. Chapter 8 can be read individually to see the performance result between the models. Chapter 9 can be used as a guide for choosing concurrency model, and contains only a summary of the most important factors.

We would like to give a special thanks to our supervisor Lone Leth Thomsen, from the Department of Computer Science, for excellent guidance, immaculate attention to detail. She supplied invaluable help throughout the project with professionalism and black humour. Her constructive criticism helped us to narrow down the subject and kept us motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
